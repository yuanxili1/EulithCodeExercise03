## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the third code exercise for the Eulith back-end engineers. 

It contains three parts:
1. A solidity contract that performs simple integer mutation on-chain.
2. A client that allows the user to deploy the previous contract to a local chain, monitor the results of the action, and reset the contract to a neutral state.
3. Asynchronously monitors the contract in a non-blocking loop.
